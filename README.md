# Overview

This project is a simple application to retrieve weather information from a REST API (Open-Meteo). This is my first attempt at building a program from the ground up that uses an API, so this will be a valueable learning experience. 

The goal of this project is, initially, to run using hard coded values, retrieving hourly weather information for Lehi, Utah. I'll then expand the functinality to allow for user defined variables such as the location to retreive information for, and optional additional information such as wind speed, UV index, etc.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
